🔍 What is a binlog (binary log) in MySQL?

The binary log (binlog) is a crucial transaction log used by MySQL to record all changes made to the database. It stores a history of all write operations (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, etc.), but not read operations (SELECT).

🧠 Purpose of the Binlog
✅ 1. Replication
-Used to replicate changes from a primary (source/master) to replica (slave) servers.
-Replicas read the binlog from the primary and execute the same changes to stay in sync.

✅ 2. Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
If you do a full backup (e.g. with mysqldump) and then apply binlogs recorded after that backup, you can restore the database to a specific time.

✅ 3. Auditing / Debugging
You can see who changed what and when — helpful for tracking data issues.

🔧 What the Binlog Contains
It logs all data-changing statements, such as:
-INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
-DDL like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE
-GRANT, REVOKE
-Transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)

⚠️ SELECT statements are NOT logged.

🔍 Binlog Formats

There are three binlog formats, defined by the variable binlog_format:

	Format					Description
STATEMENT		Logs the actual SQL statements.
ROW				Logs each changed row (more detailed and safer for replication).
MIXED			Combines STATEMENT and ROW modes intelligently.

Check your format with:
	SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';

📁 Binlog Files
-Stored as files like: mysql-bin.000001, mysql-bin.000002, etc.
Managed with an index file: mysql-bin.index

List binlogs:

	SHOW BINARY LOGS;

Read them using the command line:

	mysqlbinlog mysql-bin.000001

🧰 Binlog-Related Commands
	Task										Command
Check if binlog is enabled			SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
See current binlog file				SHOW MASTER STATUS;
Read binlog file					mysqlbinlog mysql-bin.000001
List all binlogs					SHOW BINARY LOGS;


🔒 Security / Permissions

To access binlogs or replication features, a user typically needs:
-REPLICATION SLAVE privilege (to read)
-SUPER or REPLICATION CLIENT (for some other actions)

🧼 Managing Binlogs

Binlogs grow over time — make sure to purge old binlogs.
	PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'mysql-bin.000123';

Or automatically via config:
	expire_logs_days = 7


Or in modern versions:
	binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 604800  # 7 days
