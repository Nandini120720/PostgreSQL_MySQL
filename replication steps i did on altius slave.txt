while doing replication setup on altius slave i took backup of my.cnf file ( /etc/my.cnf.bak)
[root@altdbwhsaaa03 ~]# ls -d /etc/my.cnf*
/etc/my.cnf  /etc/my.cnf.bak  /etc/my.cnf.new  /etc/my.cnf_orgnl
 	
	systemctl Stop mysql
	
- and took backup of /etc/my.cnf file on ATC and transffer it in Altius 03 slave server:
-and rsync that ATC bkup file in /etc/my.cnf file of Altius slave file:
  (use rsync to copy the backup file to replace /etc/my.cnf. It’s a safe and efficient way because 
 rsync preserves permissions and can show progress.) 
   rsync -av /etc/my.cnf.bak /etc/my.cnf   
	
	systemctl restart mysql
